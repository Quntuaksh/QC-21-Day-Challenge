# Day 01 â€” Complex Numbers & Linear Algebra Foundations  
**Date:** June 1, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Started the challenge by diving into some math basics that are crucial for understanding quantum computing. The goal was to get comfortable with things like complex numbers, vector spaces, and Dirac notation â€” stuff that seemed abstract at first but is slowly starting to make sense.

## What I Covered  
- Complex Numbers  
- Vectors & Vector Spaces  
- Bras and Kets (Dirac notation)  
- Hermitian Conjugates (Daggers)  
- Geometry of vector spaces (norms, angles, projections)  
- Operators (especially linear ones)  
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

---

## What I Learned  
- Complex numbers aren't just math tools â€” theyâ€™re the core of how quantum states are represented.  
- Understanding vectors from a geometric point of view (not just as rows/columns) really helped make things less intimidating.  
- Dirac notation (bras and kets) looked confusing at first, but it actually simplifies a lot once you get used to it.  
- Operators and their conjugates (daggers) define how states change or how we observe them â€” super important for quantum gates later.  
- The whole idea of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is more than just math theory â€” they show up in quantum measurements and gate design.  
- The more I think visually (thanks to 3Blue1Brown), the more this abstract stuff starts to click.

## Resources I Used  
- [Qubit Guide](https://qubit.guide) â€” very beginner-friendly breakdowns  
- [Essence of Linear Algebra â€” 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) â€” helped a *lot*  
- MIT OCW: Gilbert Strangâ€™s Linear Algebra â€” good reference if you want to go deeper

## Final Thoughts  
Honestly, I was a bit nervous about the math side of quantum computing, but today felt like a solid start. I didnâ€™t rush through â€” tried to build some real intuition instead of just skimming. A few things still feel hazy (like how operators behave on bras vs. kets), but I think with repetition, itâ€™ll stick.
