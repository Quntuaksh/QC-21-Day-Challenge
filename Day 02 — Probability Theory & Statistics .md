# Day 02 — Probability Theory & Statistics  
**Date:** June 2, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Revisited the good old probability and stats this time through the lens of quantum stuff. I didn’t want to just skim formulas, but actually understand *why* this randomness matters so much in quantum computing. Honestly, it felt more like re-learning with a new perspective than plain revision.

---

## What I Covered  
- Basics of Probability (the rules and logic behind uncertainty)  
- Distributions (how outcomes actually behave)  
- Bayes' Theorem (updating what you believe when new info shows up)

---

## What I Learned  
- Probability is literally everywhere it’s not just about coins and dice, it’s how we deal with not knowing things *yet*.  
- Distributions help make sense of why some outcomes are more likely than others big “aha” moment when I linked it to measurement in quantum states.  
- Bayes’ Theorem is actually wild. You start with a guess, and then adjust that guess based on reality  it’s like your brain running updates, but with math.

## Resources I Used  
- [StatQuest: Probability Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZF3vLeSHnA) — super simple, super solid  
- [StatQuest: Bayes' Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM) — finally made this make sense

## Final Thoughts  
Today felt less like learning and more like rewiring how I think about uncertainty. It’s cool how all this classical probability stuff connects directly to how quantum systems behave. Kind of hyped to get into amplitudes and the Born Rule tomorrow  feels like that’s where things start getting *really* quantum-y.

## Progress  
✅ Day 02 done (and actually understood this time)
