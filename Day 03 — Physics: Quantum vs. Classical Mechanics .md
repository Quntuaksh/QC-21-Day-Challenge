# Day 03 — Physics: Quantum vs. Classical Mechanics  
**Date:** June 3, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Today was all about diving into the *physics* side of things how quantum mechanics is just... different. I wanted to finally understand what makes quantum behavior so mind-bending compared to classical physics, especially things like superposition and wave-particle duality. These were always buzzwords before, but now I tried to make sense of them properly.

## What I Covered  
- What makes **Quantum Mechanics** different from Classical  
- **Superposition** (yes, quantum bits can be both 0 *and* 1!)  
- **Wave-Particle Duality** — the OG "quantum weirdness"  
- Philosophical chaos (like: does anything even *really* exist before we look at it?)

---

## What I Learned  
- Classical physics is great for stuff like falling apples, but it just completely breaks down when you zoom into atoms.  
- Superposition isn't just a quirky idea — it’s literally how qubits store power: by being in *multiple* states at once.  
- Wave-particle duality was the trippiest bit. Electrons acting like waves *until* we measure them?? Mind = blown.  
- The quantum world doesn’t follow our intuition — it follows math and probabilities. It’s less “what is” and more “what might be.”

## Final Thoughts  
Today’s session made me feel like I’ve been living in a fake version of reality my whole life 😅. Everything quantum is so unintuitive, yet somehow so precise. I’m starting to get why people say you don’t really “understand” quantum you just get used to the math. Also, super excited to move toward how all this craziness builds into actual quantum computing logic.
