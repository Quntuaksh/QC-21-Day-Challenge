# Day 04 â€” Introduction to Classical Computing & Boolean Algebra  
**Date:** June 4, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Today was about going back to basics â€” brushing up on classical computing fundamentals like bits, logic gates, and Boolean algebra. The idea was to refresh how classical computers work before diving deeper into how quantum ones differ.

---

## What I Covered  
- Classical **Bits** and how they store 0 or 1  
- **Logic Gates** like AND, OR, NOT, XOR  
- **Boolean Algebra** â€” the math behind logic circuits  
- Classical **circuits** vs. Quantum circuits  
- Concept of **reversible computation**  
- How **measurement** in quantum computing messes with the state

---

## What I Learned  
- Classical gates are straightforward, but when you move to quantum gates, they have to be reversible â€” that was an interesting shift.  
- Learned how even something like a NOT gate behaves totally differently when you make it quantum.  
- Measurement in quantum systems isnâ€™t just a "check" â€” it *changes* the system. Thatâ€™s wild.  
- Boolean algebra is surprisingly elegant once you get used to it. Itâ€™s like building computers with puzzle pieces.  
- Seeing how classical logic fits as a foundation before quantum logic helped a lot with building intuition.

## Final Thoughts  
I used to think logic gates were just basic electronics, but seeing them as the building blocks of computation gave me a fresh perspective. Also, realizing how quantum logic needs to be reversible (and how measuring can spoil everything) gave me a whole new appreciation for how tricky quantum circuit design is. Still early in the journey, but things are falling into place!
