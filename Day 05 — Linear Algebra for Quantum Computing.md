# Day 05 â€” Linear Algebra for Quantum Computing  
**Date:** June 5, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Today was a deep dive into the math that powers the weird world of quantum systems â€” linear algebra again, but with more focus on how it directly applies to quantum computing. Stuff like tensor products and unitary matrices sounded intimidating at first, but surprisingly started to click with a little patience.

## What I Covered  
- **Tensor Products** â€” combining quantum systems  
- **Inner & Outer Products** â€” measuring similarity and constructing matrices  
- **Unitary Matrices** â€” quantum-safe linear transformations

---

## What I Learned  
- **Tensor products** are essential for building multi-qubit systems. Itâ€™s how two separate qubits become part of one entangled system.  
- The **inner product** gives the "overlap" between quantum states, which relates to probability of measurement.  
- **Outer products** are useful for building projection operators and matrices from vectors â€” super useful in quantum math.  
- **Unitary matrices** are the only kind of transformations allowed in quantum circuits since they preserve norm (aka probabilities still add up to 1).  
- It's amazing how these abstract math operations turn into real quantum operations. Itâ€™s like seeing code turn into physics.

## Final Thoughts  
Definitely felt a little overloaded with math today, but taking it slow helped. Iâ€™m starting to see how quantum computing isn't just physics or CS it's a full blend of linear algebra, probability, and logic. Tensor products are still a bit tricky conceptually, but I know theyâ€™ll make more sense once I start building actual quantum circuits.
