# Day 06 â€” Classical Algorithms & Data Structures Review  
**Date:** June 6, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Revisited the core building blocks of classical computing algorithms and data structures. I wanted to refresh my mind before stepping into quantum territory. Itâ€™s wild how much of this Iâ€™d forgotten, but also cool how quickly it came back.

---

## What I Covered  
- Big-O Notation  
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick)  
- Searching (Linear and Binary)

---

## What I Learned  
- Big-O isnâ€™t just a nerdy notation it literally defines how well your code scales. Itâ€™s the difference between an app that works and one that crashes with big data.  
- Sorting algorithms are like battle-tested recipes simple ones like Bubble Sort are easy to understand but inefficient, while Merge and Quick Sort are optimized and elegant.  
- Itâ€™s weirdly satisfying to trace the steps of a binary search I now understand how much faster it is than just looking through everything.

## Final Thoughts  
It felt like tuning up an old machine â€” dusty at first, but satisfying once it started running smoothly. I didnâ€™t expect to enjoy sorting this much, but visualizing the algorithms really helped.
