# Day 09 â€” Quantum Gates & Circuits  
**Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Today was a deep-dive *revision* day. After building and simulating gates like X, H, Z, and CNOT in the last hands-on session, I wanted to take a step back and really understand *why* they behave the way they do. The goal was to consolidate the basics of quantum logic gates and grasp how they shape quantum states.

## What I Covered  
- Pauli Gates: X (bit-flip), Y, and Z (phase-flip)  
- Hadamard Gate: Used for creating superposition  
- Phase Gates: Subtle rotations in the quantum phase  
- CNOT Gate: Crucial for creating entanglement  
- Unitary Transformations: What makes quantum gates reversible  
- How gates can be visualized using matrix multiplication on qubit vectors  
- Revisiting simple 2-qubit circuits to explore how gates interact

## What I Learned  
- Quantum gates are like building blocks of weird but powerful logic. Unlike classical gates, they always have to be reversible which makes designing them both elegant and unintuitive at first.  
- The **Hadamard gate** felt especially interesting itâ€™s like the magical entry point to quantum parallelism.  
- Seeing how **CNOT gates** act as control mechanisms was cool. It made me realize how even with a few simple gates, we can create complex behaviors like entanglement.  
- Visualizing unitary operations as *rotations in quantum state space* helped a lot especially when watching the Bloch Sphere animations.  
- Revisiting familiar gates felt surprisingly new this time with more intuition rather than just formulas.

## Final Thoughts  
Honestly, today was one of those "slow and steady" days â€” no flashy new topic, but a necessary pause to absorb whatâ€™s been flying past me. I feel more confident about how gates work, and thatâ€™s going to pay off big when we start chaining them into actual algorithms. The theory is finally syncing up with the hands-on intuition.
