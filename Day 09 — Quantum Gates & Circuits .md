# Day 09 â€” Quantum Gates & Circuits  
**Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
After getting introduced to the idea of qubits and circuits, I wanted to go deeper into the actual gates and how they manipulate quantum information. This is where things start to resemble actual computation.

---

## What I Covered  
- Hadamard Gate  
- Pauli Gates (X, Y, Z)  
- CNOT Gate and Entanglement  
- Circuit Diagrams and Gate Composition

---

## What I Learned  
- The Hadamard gate still trips me out â€” it turns a basic 0 into a superposition of 0 and 1. Like flipping a coin but keeping it spinning.  
- CNOT was my favorite today. Itâ€™s like an IF-THEN for quantum states, and itâ€™s what allows *entanglement* â€” the spooky quantum behavior everyone talks about.  
- Circuit diagrams helped a lot. Visualizing how gates flow and how qubits interact made it feel less like magic and more like real computation.

## Resources I Used  
- [Quantum Gates â€” Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook)  
- [CNOT Gate Explained â€” Qiskit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9EC6e2Nwc)

## Final Thoughts  
Learning about quantum gates is like unlocking cheat codes for reality. Classical logic gates feel like wooden blocks now, and these are like multidimensional Rubikâ€™s cubes. Iâ€™m having so much fun it doesnâ€™t feel like studying.
