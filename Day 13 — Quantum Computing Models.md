# Day 13 â€” Quantum Computing Models  
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

## What I Set Out to Do  
Todayâ€™s focus was on the different ways quantum computation can be approached beyond just the circuit model weâ€™ve been using. I wanted to understand what makes these models unique, and why researchers might use one over the other.

---

## What I Covered  
- **Circuit Model** â€” the most common framework (what Qiskit uses), based on quantum gates acting on qubits  
- **Adiabatic Quantum Computing** â€” slow evolution of the systemâ€™s Hamiltonian to solve problems  
- **Measurement-Based Quantum Computing** (MBQC) â€” computing via entanglement and measurements on a pre-prepared quantum state  
- The philosophical and practical differences between these approaches  
- Why not all quantum computers use the same logic to compute

---

## What I Learned  
- The **Circuit Model** is intuitive once you get used to gates and qubit states, but itâ€™s not the only way to do quantum computing that realization was kind of wild.  
- **Adiabatic QC** feels more like physics than computing itâ€™s like gently guiding the system to a solution rather than telling it exactly what to do. Thatâ€™s a whole different paradigm!  
- **Measurement-Based QC** blew my mind. You prep an entangled resource state, and then just measure strategically to compute. Itâ€™s minimal, weird, and elegant all at once.  
- Each model has its strengths  some are better for error correction, some for optimization problems, and some for hardware feasibility.  
- Itâ€™s not just about *how* to compute, but also *whatâ€™s best suited* to the problem and quantum hardware available.

## Final Thoughts  
This was one of those "oh wow, this is way deeper than I thought" days. Quantum computing isn't a monolith â€” it's more like a toolkit of philosophies and models, each with its own quirks and use cases. Iâ€™m starting to really appreciate how creative this field is. It's not just about solving problems; it's about rethinking what it means to *compute*.
