# Day 14 — Quantum Programming Basics + Expert Session  
**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Today was all about two things:  
1. Writing my first actual quantum circuits using Qiskit.  
2. Attending a special expert session on real-world quantum applications.

---

## What I Covered  
### 🧪 Qiskit Programming
- Setup Qiskit environment and ran basic quantum circuits  
- Used gates like X, H, and CNOT  
- Built and measured a Bell state  
- Visualized output states and observed superposition + entanglement  
- Simulated circuits with Aer and saw probabilistic outcomes

### 🎙️ Expert Session Highlights  
**Speaker:** Karthiganesh (Founder, KwantumG)  
- Real-world quantum use cases (chemistry, cryptography, logistics)  
- Quick intro to Quantum Machine Learning  
- Quantum vs classical: where quantum clearly wins  
- Future career & research scope

---

## What I Learned  
- Coding with Qiskit gave form to everything we’ve been learning — super satisfying to finally “do” quantum.  
- Measurements aren’t just abstract — you feel the randomness and interference in the results.  
- Quantum Machine Learning might be the next frontier for innovation.  
- It was motivating to hear how quantum is already making waves in industry, not just research labs.

## Resources I Used  
- [Qiskit — First Quantum Circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaAjxcIFLtM)  
- [Qiskit Docs – Getting Started](https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html)  
- Expert Talk Recording (QuCode YouTube Live)

## Final Thoughts  
Seeing theory come to life in Qiskit + hearing from a founder working on cutting-edge quantum projects = amazing combo. Today made the field feel real, alive, and full of possibility.
