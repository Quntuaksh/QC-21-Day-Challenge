# Day 16 â€” Shorâ€™s Algorithm & Quantum Cryptography  
**Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Todayâ€™s focus was on one of the most famous quantum algorithms ever: **Shorâ€™s Algorithm**. It's known for breaking RSA encryption something that shook the classical cryptography world. The day was also about exploring the broader space of **quantum cryptography** and what a post-quantum world might look like.

---

## What I Covered  
- The basic idea behind **Shorâ€™s Algorithm** â€” factoring large integers using quantum period finding  
- Why this breaks **RSA encryption**, which relies on the difficulty of factoring  
- A high-level walkthrough of the algorithm (no, I didnâ€™t implement it... yet)  
- Concepts around **quantum-secure cryptographic schemes** and what kind of encryption might survive the quantum era  
- Current research on **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** and **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**  

---

## What I Learned  
- Classical computers take exponential time to factor large numbers. Quantum computers? *Polynomial*. Thatâ€™s why Shorâ€™s algorithm is such a big deal.  
- While full-scale implementation isnâ€™t practical yet (needs millions of logical qubits), the **threat is real** especially for encrypted data meant to remain secret for years.  
- It was fascinating to think of cryptography not as unbreakable, but just *too hard to break for now*. Quantum changes that timeline.  
- Post-quantum cryptography doesnâ€™t use quantum mechanics itâ€™s just designed to resist quantum attacks.  
- The concept of **Quantum Key Distribution** is honestly beautiful physics guarantees security, not just math.

## Final Thoughts  
This was a big-picture day. I didnâ€™t get lost in the math, but rather zoomed out to understand why **Shorâ€™s Algorithm is the warning bell** for current encryption. Even though we donâ€™t have quantum computers powerful enough (yet), the race to secure our digital future has already begun. This felt like a glimpse into the future of cybersecurity.
