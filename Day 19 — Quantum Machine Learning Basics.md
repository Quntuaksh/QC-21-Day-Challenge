# Day 19 â€” Quantum Machine Learning Basics  
**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**Challenge:** 21-Day Quantum Computing Challenge (QC-2)

---

## What I Set Out to Do  
Today I dove into **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** one of the most talked-about intersections in tech right now. I wanted to get a basic understanding of how quantum computing could potentially boost or rethink traditional ML methods.

## What I Covered  
- Quantum Data Encoding (Amplitude, Angle, Basis encoding)  
- Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)  
- Variational circuits as QML models  
- Potential speedups and challenges in QML  
- Applications in classification, clustering, and optimization

---

## What I Learned  
- Encoding classical data into quantum states is non-trivial â€” and the method chosen affects the expressiveness of the model.  
- QNNs are built using parameterized gates and layered like classical neural nets â€” but training them is a whole different ballgame.  
- While the promise is big, current QML models are still mostly experimental â€” but the possibilities are exciting.  
- QML shines in high-dimensional spaces and problems involving quantum data (like molecules or quantum sensors).  
- Visualizing how entanglement can create correlations in data feels like magic â€” but with math.

## Final Thoughts  
Quantum ML is clearly still evolving, but itâ€™s one of the most exciting areas for future innovation. Even just understanding how data gets encoded made me realize how different quantum perspectives can be. This might just be the most futuristic topic weâ€™ve explored so far.
